    This brings down girls self esteem and self image.  Barbie Dolls have been around for 
    decades and have had a negative impact on girls.<br>
    This brings down girls self esteem and self image. 
    Although these dolls are fun to play with, the physique that is extremely unreal. 
    For example the neck is twice as long as a normal human, her wais is smaller than her head
    (16 inch waist) and her ankles are 6 inches long which means Barbie would have had to walk on all fours. 
    Anyways, the careers Barbie has had are pretty original. Veternarian,
    Doctor, Astronaut, Fashion Designer, things like that. This type of physique is causing girls to look want to look like 
    this causing them to have negative body images.  </p>
