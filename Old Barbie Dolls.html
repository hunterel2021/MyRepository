   <h3> Original Barbie Dolls </h3>
    <p> Barbie Dolls have been around for decades and have had a negative impact on girls.<br> 
    This brings down girls self esteem and self image.   Although these dolls are fun to play with,
     the physique that is extremely unreal. For example the neck is twice as long as a normal human,
     her waist is smaller than her head, (16 inch waist) and her ankles are 6 inches long which means 
     Barbie would have had to walk on all fours. This type of physique is causing girls to want to look like 
    this causing them to have negative body images.  </p>
